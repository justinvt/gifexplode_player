This was originally designed to be a very basic player to provide functionality people were asking for on gifexplode (http://www.gifexplode.com/1#frame103).  In theory it could be used for any website with a series of images that can be greped based on a specific src url format.  I will be refactoring over the next day or two, but it seems to work on most browsers (ff, safari, opera).
